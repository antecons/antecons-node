Antecons node.js
================

Node.js binding for the [Antecons API](https://api.antecons.net).

Installation and setup
----------------------

Get it from `npm`:

    npm install --save antecons

Include `antecons` somewhere in your project and instantiate the API with a
config containing your API key and API secret:

```js    
var Antecons = require('antecons')({
  apiKey: 'your_api_key',
  apiSecret: 'your_api_secret',
  debug: true  // To get console messages.
});
```

The `debug` value is optional and should only be `true` during development and
test.

Usage example
-------------

Currently, the API is quite simple and only implements a single resource: the
`datasource`. To fetch a list of all datasources:

```js
Antecons.datasource.list(function(err, datasources) {
  console.log(datasources);
});
```

The API calls return a promise so you can also do this:

```js
Antecons.datasource.list()
  .then(function(datasources) {
    console.log(datasources);
  });
```

Testing
-------

    npm test
